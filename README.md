# Efficient Input Experiment Design

This repo contains the code and results from "Paper Title".
Words words words

## Installation and Running
If you have conda installed, run `conda env create -f environment.yml`. Then run
`source activate lqr` and subsequently `python setup.py develop`. This installs
the needed libraries and appends the environments to the path. Then, the script is
`gen_script.py` which will run the training for the sampler.

If you do not have conda, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then rnu `python setup.py
develop`.

## Generating the graphs
In the spirit of reproducibility, we've uploaded all of the trained models to this repository.
To run one of the trained models and generate all the graphs for the paper, run `TBD`
